FaaS 
------------------

Our project is also named FaaS, which is a project based on Tencent Serverless Cloud 
Function(SCF_) to provide users fast images processing services. We use their SCF 
service to develop our cloud function, use their Cloud Object Storage(COS_) to store 
figures and use `API Gateway`_ to custom our APIs to release to users.
